# SuperSolvrs

## Description
This app is a virtual reality game that was created as a Devbootcamp final project. It's a game that focuses on making children learn and have fun while doing it. All you need is a google cardboard, a phone, and you're good to go!

## Code 
This is a rails app that uses A-Frame, which is simular to html, but is used to render 3d objects. Check A-frame's website for documentation on html and javscript.

## Strecth Goals
Since we had a week to do this in a new framework the code is a bit messy. I would love to clean this up in the furture as well as get a better understanding of A-frame.
